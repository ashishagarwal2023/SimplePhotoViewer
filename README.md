# SimplePhotoViewer
Simple Photo Viewer Made Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

This is a simple yet web photo viewer that can be used to upload a image, view the image, copy it's data url, and download it back then.
It supports only PNG, WEBP, JPG and JPEG formats, but you can anyway upload any kind of files. If any errors were occured, make sure the file is valid and the type is PNG, WEBP, JPG or JPEG.

It's 100% by me! I hope you may like it. I will soon add more features!
